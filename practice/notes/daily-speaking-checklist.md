Article-case drills + immediate correction (8–10 min)

- [ ] For each: say the question (Wer/Wen/Wem) out loud, choose article, speak sentence, write it
- [ ] Convert 2 sentences to Perfekt out loud

Tense/conjugation drill (5–8 min)
- [ ] Pick one verb from `practice/perfect-tense/session-*.md`
- [ ] Say a 6-sentence chain in present (ich, du, er/sie/es, wir, ihr, sie)
- [ ] Repeat the chain in Perfekt; emphasize the auxiliary (HABE/IST/HABEN/SEIN)

Free speaking / role play (8–10 min)
- [ ] Improvise 2–3 sentences changing detail (ingredient, time, reason)
- [ ] Use 2–3 linking words (weil, damit, während)
- [ ] If possible, do a 3–5 minute role-play with a partner or teacher

Quick review & note (2–3 min)
- [ ] Add one short entry in `practice/notes/learning-plan.md` with this template:
  - Date: YYYY-MM-DD  Time: 00:00  Done: (paragraph / 4 drills / tense drill / free speak)
  - Hard: (one short note)
  - Next: (one small action item)

Today's fixes (one-line each — pick max 2)
- 1) ______________________________________________
- 2) ______________________________________________

Recording naming convention (copy-paste)
- Use: YYYY-MM-DD_topic_take.mp3 (or .m4a)
- Example: 2025-11-13_grocery_reading1.mp3
- Save under: `practice/recordings/` (create this folder if missing). Add `practice/recordings/.gitignore` if you prefer not to commit recordings.

Weekly checkpoints (once per week)
- [ ] Teacher session: bring 1 paragraph + 6 drills (30 min)
- [ ] Self assessment: compare a Monday and Friday 60s recording; count pauses and article mistakes
- [ ] Update `practice/notes/learning-plan.md` with 3 goals for the coming week

Monthly checkpoint (once per month)
- [ ] Add 1 new target (e.g., separable verbs in paragraphs)
- [ ] Prepare a 2-minute spoken summary of the month; save to `practice/recordings/`

Optional extras (one-click additions I can make)
- [ ] Printable single-page PDF version (I can generate and add to `docs/`)
- [ ] `practice/recordings/.gitignore` and short README for naming conventions
- [ ] Answer key file for grocery drills: `practice/essentials/grocery-cooking-answers.md`

Small tips (micro-habits)
- Always say the question (Wer/Wen/Wem) out loud before you answer.
- Emphasize auxiliaries in Perfekt to keep word order feeling natural.
- If one noun causes repeated errors, add it to `practice/notes/problem-nouns.md` and practice it separately.

Done — keep this checklist handy and update `practice/notes/learning-plan.md` after each session.
