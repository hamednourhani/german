# Daily Speaking Plan — Focused on improving oral fluency

Purpose

This is a compact daily plan to improve German speaking (pronunciation, speed, accuracy, and confidence). It uses the practice materials already in the repo (paragraphs, article drills, tense sessions, and the teacher's article table). Follow the routine daily and update `practice/notes/learning-plan.md` after each session.

How to use this plan

- Time per day: 30–50 minutes (pick the slot you can commit to daily).
- Use the provided paragraph and drills (grocery & cooking, articles, present/Perfekt sessions) as core material.
- Record yourself and compare to improve clarity and rhythm.

Daily routine (compact, ~40 minutes)

Below is an expanded, practical walk-through for each daily step — what to do, why it helps your speaking, and one concrete tip you can apply immediately.

1) Warm-up (5 min)
- What to do: Say 10 short present-tense sentences aloud (simple actions like "Ich stehe auf.", "Ich mache Kaffee.").
- Why: warms up your mouth and gets you into German word order and basic conjugation patterns.
- Tip: keep sentences short and deliberate; focus on clear verb endings (ich -e, du -st, er -t).

2) Paragraph read & shadow (10–12 min)
- What to do: Read the grocery paragraph in `practice/paragraphs/grocery-cooking-present.md` slowly once. Then shadow it (speak along) a second time, matching rhythm and linking. Record one full reading on your phone or computer.
- Why: shadowing builds natural prosody and linking; recording lets you hear pronunciation and hesitation you can’t notice while speaking.
- Tip: do two shadow passes — one slow for accuracy, one near-natural speed. After recording, note 1–2 specific fixes (vowel quality, article, or sentence linking).

3) Article-case drills + immediate correction (8–10 min)
- What to do: Complete 4 of the 8 drills in `practice/essentials/grocery-cooking-article-drills.md` (present). For each sentence: say the question (Wer/Wen/Wem), pick the article using the teacher's table, speak the full sentence aloud, write it down. Convert 2 of the sentences to Perfekt out loud.
- Why: enforces the mental step (ask Wer/Wen/Wem → choose case → pick article) and connects article choice to spoken fluency; conversion trains auxiliaries and past participles.
- Tip: always say the question out loud before answering ("Wen?") — it becomes an effective habit to avoid article mistakes.

4) Tense/conjugation drill (5–8 min)
- What to do: Pick one verb from `practice/perfect-tense/session-1.md`, `session-2.md`, or `session-3.md`. Say a 6-sentence chain (ich, du, er/sie/es, wir, ihr, sie) in present, then repeat the chain in Perfekt.
- Why: builds automatic conjugation patterns and trains auxiliary selection (haben vs. sein) and past participle placement.
- Tip: when saying Perfekt, emphasize the auxiliary (e.g., "ich HABE gekocht") so the verb-second feeling stays natural.

5) Free speaking / role play (8–10 min)
- What to do: Use the paragraph as context and improvise 2–3 new sentences (change an ingredient, add a time or reason). If possible, role-play with a partner or your teacher for a 5-minute exchange.
- Why: forces real-time sentence construction and use of conjunctions (weil, damit, während) — key to fluency.
- Tip: aim to use 2–3 linking words per mini-monologue so you practice clause connectors under speaking pressure.

6) Quick review & note (2–3 min)
- What to do: Add one short session note in `practice/notes/learning-plan.md`: what was easy, what was hard, and one small next goal (e.g., "Next: focus on dative after 'mit'").
- Why: a brief reflection consolidates learning and seeds the next session’s focus.
- Tip: keep the note one line so it’s fast and you’ll do it consistently.

Weekly components (once per week)

- Teacher session (30 min): bring one paragraph and 6 drills; ask your teacher to correct your recordings and highlight article/case mistakes.
- Self assessment: pick a 1-minute recorded paragraph from Monday and one from Friday; compare fluency and count hesitation markers ("äh", long pauses). Note improvement.
- Update `practice/notes/learning-plan.md` with 3 bullet goals for next week.

Monthly components

- Add one new target: e.g., "Add 3 separable verbs into paragraphs and practice them in Perfekt".
- If comfortable, prepare a 2-minute spoken summary of the month (what you've learned) and save it as an audio file in `practice/recordings/`.

Concrete prompts you can say to me (the assistant) after a session

- "Check my paragraph: I read `grocery-cooking-present.md` and my recording is X — suggest 3 pronunciation/word-order fixes." (I can suggest targeted corrections and example phrasing.)
- "Generate 6 new article drills about buying vegetables (present + Perfekt) and focus on Dativ vs Akkusativ." (I will use the teacher's table.)
- "Make 5 short role-play prompts for grocery shopping using separable verbs and modal verbs." 

Metrics to track (simple)

- Fluency: record 60 seconds once per week and note the number of pauses >1 second.
- Accuracy: number of article/case mistakes in a 10-sentence quiz (done with teacher or self-checked against answer key).
- Confidence: subjective rating 1–5 at end of each week.

Practical tips

- Recordings: use your phone or a simple voice recorder; name files with date and short tag, e.g., `2025-11-13_grocery_reading1.mp3` and store under `practice/recordings/`.
- Shadowing: pick a natural speed first, then try a faster run; the aim is intelligible speech not speed alone.
- Error handling: when you notice the same article mistake 3 times, add the noun to a short list `practice/notes/problem-nouns.md` and practice it in mini-drills.

Small templates for quick use

- Quick session header to add to `learning-plan.md` after each day:
  - Date: YYYY-MM-DD
  - Time: 00:00 (minutes)
  - Done: (paragraph read / 4 article drills / tense drill / free speak)
  - Hard: (one short note)
  - Next: (one action item)

- Example assistant prompt you can paste:
  - "Refer to the teacher's article table. Generate 6 present + Perfekt drills about cooking with the verbs: kochen, schneiden, kaufen. Include the answer key. Medium difficulty."

Files referenced in this plan

- `practice/paragraphs/grocery-cooking-present.md`
- `practice/paragraphs/grocery-cooking-perfekt.md`
- `practice/essentials/grocery-cooking-article-drills.md`
- `practice/essentials/articles.md` (merged table + exercises)
- `practice/perfect-tense/session-1.md`, `session-2.md`, `session-3.md`
- `practice/notes/learning-plan.md` (update this after daily sessions)

If you want, I can also:

- Generate a printable daily checklist (one-page) you can print and check off each day.
- Create an automatic weekly prompt that summarizes your `learning-plan.md` entries and suggests the next week's drills.

Would you like a printable one-page checklist now, or should I (A) generate the weekly printable summary, (B) create an answer key for the grocery drills, or (C) add a `practice/recordings/.gitignore` and a starter README for recording naming conventions? Pick one and I'll do it next.

Appendix — How to shadow (step-by-step)

What shadowing is (short)
- Shadowing = speaking along with (or immediately after) a model voice or your own text, matching rhythm, stress, linking and phrasing. The goal is to copy natural prosody and flow, not just words.

Two simple shadowing methods
1. Self-shadow: read the paragraph slowly once, then speak along with it on the second read (match rhythm and linking).
2. Audio-shadow: play a native recording or TTS and speak along, matching timing and stress.

Step-by-step shadow routine (use with the grocery paragraph)
1. Prep (1–2 min): read silently once, mark commas/conjunctions, and underline tricky nouns.
2. Slow read (2–3 min): read aloud slowly and clearly; focus on word forms and clause order.
3. Shadow pass 1 — accuracy (3–4 min): speak along with your slow read, matching timing and linking.
4. Shadow pass 2 — near-natural (3–4 min): speak again faster with more natural rhythm; soften long pauses.
5. Record one full take (1–2 min): use your phone; save with a dated name (e.g., `2025-11-13_grocery_reading1.mp3`).
6. Quick review (2–3 min): listen and note 1–2 specific fixes (articles, vowel quality, pauses).

Micro-tips
- Say the question (Wer/Wen/Wem) out loud before nouns you struggle with — this habit reduces article mistakes.
- Emphasize auxiliaries in Perfekt ("ich HABE gekocht") so word order feels natural.
- Link small words (e.g., "und ich" with gentle connection) to build fluid speech.
- For subordinate clauses (weil, damit): pause before the conjunction, then push the verb to the clause end and pronounce it fully.

Quick checklist you can use while practicing
- [ ] Mark paragraph (commas, conjunctions, tricky nouns)
- [ ] Slow read aloud once (accuracy)
- [ ] Shadow pass 1 (match rhythm + linking)
- [ ] Shadow pass 2 (near-natural speed)
- [ ] Record one take and label file
- [ ] Listen and note 1–2 fixes for next day

Measuring improvement
- Compare two recordings (start vs end of week): count long pauses (>1s), hesitation markers ("äh"), and article mistakes. Track one prioritized issue per week.

Common mistakes to avoid
- Shadowing too fast before accuracy pass — always do the slow pass first.
- Swallowing article endings — focus on endings in slow read.
- Forgetting subordinate-clause word order — practice clauses alone if needed.

Optional extras I can create
- A printable one-line checklist to tape near your phone.
- A short TTS audio file (or suggested TTS settings) for the grocery paragraph to use for audio-shadowing.

If you want either of those, tell me which and I'll add it to the repo.
