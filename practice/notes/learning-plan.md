# Learning Reflection & Plan

## What I have learned so far

- Present tense conjugation for regular verbs (e.g., machen, lernen, arbeiten) and common irregular verbs (essen, lesen, gehen).
- Perfekt formation using `haben` and `sein`, with past participles for regular (`ge-...-t`) and irregular verbs.
- Basic articles and case uses (Nominativ, Akkusativ, Dativ, Genitiv) for daily nouns (Mann, Frau, Kind, Brot, Gemüse).
- Common prepositions used with movement and location (in, auf, zu, mit) and how they affect cases.
- Using conjunctions to extend sentences: und, aber, weil, damit, während, deshalb, obwohl.

## What I still want to practice / learn next

- More paragraph-length practice combining conjunctions and multiple verbs (present and Perfekt).
- More practice with Dativ vs. Akkusativ after prepositions (e.g., "in den Park" vs. "in dem Park").
- Separable verbs in Perfekt and present (e.g., "aufstehen", "mitbringen").
- Time expressions and sentence flow (gestern, heute, später, am Morgen).
- Common modal verbs in Perfekt and present (können, müssen, wollen).

## How I'd like to use this file

- Before a session, update the "What I still want to practice" list to direct the next set of exercises.
- After a session, add a short note with what felt easy and what was hard (1–2 lines).

## Teacher resources (use before generating practices)

- Always consult the article/case table your teacher prepared before doing article exercises. If the table file is in this repo, add its path here (example: `practice/essentials/kasus.docx` or `practice/essentials/articles.md`). Use the table to decide which article to use for the noun in each sentence (Nominativ / Akkusativ / Dativ / Genitiv).
- When I ask you to generate new practice, please include a line in the prompt that says: "Refer to the teacher's article table for article selection" so I will build exercises that match the table's conventions.

### Teacher's article table (copied from screenshot)

Full articles by case

| Gender | Nominativ | Akkusativ | Dativ | Genitiv |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mask. | **der** | **den** | **dem** | **des...s** |
| fem.  | **die** | **die** | **der** | **der** |
| neutrum | **das** | **das** | **dem** | **des...s** |
| Plural | **die** | **die** | **der** | **der** |

Common adjective/article endings (helpful shorthand)

| Gender | Nominativ | Akkusativ | Dativ | Genitiv |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mask. | r | n | m | s...s |
| fem.  | e | e | r | r |
| neutrum | s | s | m | s...s |
| Plural | e | e | r | r |

Keep this table in mind when you pick articles: first ask "Wer/Wen/Wem?" to identify the case, then use the gender + case row to select the correct article/ending.

## Preferences for generated paragraphs (optional but recommended)

- Preferred topic(s): grocery & cooking, commuting & work, health & appointments, errands & banking (list one or more).
- Preferred vocabulary to include (comma-separated, e.g., "einkaufen, kochen, bezahlen, aufstehen").
- Preferred paragraph length: short (4–6 sentences) / medium (8–10) / long (12+).

Add or update these fields before a session so generated paragraphs match your goals.

## Quick notes (edit each session)

- Last session (YYYY-MM-DD): Practiced Perfekt paragraphs; felt comfortable with "haben" usage but need more practice choosing "sein".
- Next session goal: Add 3 separable verbs into a paragraph and convert to Perfekt.
