# Learning Reflection & Plan

## What I have learned so far

- Present tense conjugation for regular verbs (e.g., machen, lernen, arbeiten) and common irregular verbs (essen, lesen, gehen).
- Perfekt formation using `haben` and `sein`, with past participles for regular (`ge-...-t`) and irregular verbs.
- Basic articles and case uses (Nominativ, Akkusativ, Dativ, Genitiv) for daily nouns (Mann, Frau, Kind, Brot, Gemüse).
- Common prepositions used with movement and location (in, auf, zu, mit) and how they affect cases.
- Using conjunctions to extend sentences: und, aber, weil, damit, während, deshalb, obwohl.

## What I still want to practice / learn next

- More paragraph-length practice combining conjunctions and multiple verbs (present and Perfekt).
- More practice with Dativ vs. Akkusativ after prepositions (e.g., "in den Park" vs. "in dem Park").
- Separable verbs in Perfekt and present (e.g., "aufstehen", "mitbringen").
- Time expressions and sentence flow (gestern, heute, später, am Morgen).
- Common modal verbs in Perfekt and present (können, müssen, wollen).

## How I'd like to use this file

- Before a session, update the "What I still want to practice" list to direct the next set of exercises.
- After a session, add a short note with what felt easy and what was hard (1–2 lines).

## Quick notes (edit each session)

- Last session (YYYY-MM-DD): Practiced Perfekt paragraphs; felt comfortable with "haben" usage but need more practice choosing "sein".
- Next session goal: Add 3 separable verbs into a paragraph and convert to Perfekt.
